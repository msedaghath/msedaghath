Chapter about database selection 
(( name and structure next chapters for next time ))


Data structure, description for the database , entity relationship 

one sub chapter will be - db management system - 
why I have chosen this one 
sub chapter 

first thing first , write the bullet points 
no need for introduction - conclusion 

chapter 1 , chapter 2 
--- here the requirements need to be described -- or in chapter 4/5
chapter 2 -= related textbook chapters 
chapter 3 = describing the technology  - domain knowledge 
chapter 4 = methodology  - whole approach - how you want to solve this task 
chapter 5 = doing/describe of the system - design the system  ++ can be mixed with 6
chapter 6 = implementation 
chapter 7 = evaluation - against some requirements - test case / this can be also requirements 
chapter 8 = conclusion and outlook - what can be improved  

**Document Structure**
======================

**Chapter 1: Database Selection**
==========================

### Table of Contents

* [Data Structure](#data-structure)
* [Description for the Database](#description-for-the-database)
* [Entity Relationship](#entity-relationship)

### Data Structure
#### Key Considerations

* **Scalability**: How will the database handle increased data volume and user traffic?
* **Performance**: What are the expected query patterns, and how will the database optimize for them?
* **Data Types**: What types of data will be stored, and how will they be represented in the database?

### Description for the Database
#### Key Considerations

* **Purpose**: What is the primary purpose of the database, and what kind of data will it store?
* **User Requirements**: What are the expected user interactions, and how will the database support them?
* **System Constraints**: What are the technical constraints of the system, such as hardware or software limitations?

### Entity Relationship
#### Key Considerations

* **Entities**: What are the main entities that will be stored in the database, and how will they relate to each other?
* **Attributes**: What attributes will be associated with each entity, and how will they be represented in the database?
* **Relationships**: How will the different entities interact with each other, and what kind of relationships will exist between them?

---

**Chapter 2: DB Management System**
================================

### Why I Chose This Approach

* **Scalability**: A DBMS can handle increased data volume and user traffic more efficiently than a custom-built solution.
* **Performance**: A well-designed DBMS can optimize query performance and reduce latency.
* **Maintenance**: A DBMS provides a standardized interface for managing the database, making it easier to maintain and update.

### Key Considerations

* **ACID Compliance**: What are the requirements for atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability in the DBMS?
* **Concurrency Control**: How will the DBMS handle concurrent access to shared resources?
* **Data Normalization**: How will the DBMS ensure data consistency and reduce data redundancy?

---

**Chapter 3: Entity Relationship Modeling**
=====================================

### Key Considerations

* **Entity Identification**: What are the main entities that will be stored in the database, and how will they be identified?
* **Attribute Definition**: What attributes will be associated with each entity, and how will they be defined?
* **Relationship Modeling**: How will the different entities interact with each other, and what kind of relationships will exist between them?

### Entity Relationship Diagrams
#### Key Considerations

* **Entity Types**: What are the main entity types that will be stored in the database?
* **Attribute Types**: What are the main attribute types that will be used to represent data in the database?
* **Relationship Types**: What are the different relationship types that will exist between entities, and how will they be represented?
