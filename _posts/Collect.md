Using any of the controlling methods we can collect data from each print [[firmware]] or [[Octoprint]] 

# Which data types can be collected? 

[[Sensors]] : 
1.  [[Temperature]] - from [[Bed]] or [[Nozzle]]
2.  [[Nozzle]] position and axis control  
3. [[Camera]] feed 
List all the sensors that I have missed that are available on a Prusa Mk4

**Additional Sensors Available on Prusa Mk4**

While the Prusa Mk4 is equipped with various sensors, here are some additional ones you may want to consider:

### 1. **Temperature Sensor for Bed Leveling**
A temperature sensor can be used to monitor the bed's temperature during leveling, ensuring accurate and reliable results.

### 2. **Humidity Sensor**
A humidity sensor can help track the ambient environment's humidity levels, which can affect print quality and reliability.

### 3. **Air Quality Sensor**
An air quality sensor can monitor pollutants in the air, such as particulate matter (PM), ozone (O3), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), to ensure a healthy printing environment.

### 4. **Vibration Sensor**
A vibration sensor can detect any unusual vibrations or movements during printing, helping you identify potential issues with your printer or print head.

### 5.  Environmental Monitoring System
An environmental monitoring system can track temperature, humidity, and other factors that may affect print quality and reliability.

These sensors can be integrated into a smart home automation system to provide real-time data on the environment in which the 3D printer is operating.


## Data Types that Can Be Collected

### Environmental Sensors

*   Temperature data can be collected from various sources, including:
    *   Bed temperature sensors
    *   Nozzle temperature sensors
*   Position and axis control data for the nozzle can provide insights into its movement and orientation.
*   Camera feed data can capture visual information about the printing process, such as object shape, color, and texture.

### Additional Data Types

*   Other potential data types that can be collected include:
    *   Print time and speed
    *   Material usage and waste generation
    *   Layer thickness and adhesion
    *   Print head movement and acceleration
    *   Environmental conditions such as humidity, air pressure, and ambient temperature


You are a maintenance engineer for a 3D printing facility, and you need to generate a report on the current state of our printers. The objective is to provide a comprehensive overview of the firmware and OctoPrint data collected from each printer, highlighting any issues or areas for improvement.

Please provide a detailed analysis of the sensors and data types collected, including environmental sensor data such as temperature, humidity, and air pressure. Additionally, summarize the camera feed data captured during printing sessions. The report should be written in a formal tone, suitable for an engineering audience.

Format your response as a step-by-step guide, outlining the key findings and recommendations for optimizing printer performance. Use bullet points to present the data collected from each sensor, and include visual aids such as charts or graphs where necessary.
