**Smart 3D Printing System Overview**
=====================================

Our ultimate goal is to create an intelligent system that integrates control, data collection, monitoring, and machine learning capabilities to optimize the 3D printing process.

### Key Objectives

#### 1. **Control**

* Establish a web-based interface for remote control of 3D printers
* Implement real-time monitoring and automation of print jobs
* Ensure seamless integration with existing printer hardware

#### 2. **Data Collection**

* Develop a robust data collection system to track print parameters, such as temperature, speed, and material usage
* Collect sensor data from the printer, including temperature, humidity, and vibration levels
* Store collected data in a secure and accessible database

#### 3. **Monitoring**

* Implement real-time monitoring of the printing process, including temperature, layer thickness, and print time
* Use machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies and predict potential issues
* Provide alerts and notifications for critical events, such as printer malfunctions or material shortages

#### 4. **Machine Learning**

* Train machine learning models on collected data to optimize print settings and reduce errors
* Develop predictive analytics capabilities to forecast print times, material usage, and quality
* Continuously update and refine the machine learning models to improve performance and accuracy

### Benefits

* Improved print quality and reduced defects
* Increased productivity and efficiency through automation and optimization
* Enhanced remote monitoring and control capabilities
* Data-driven decision making for improved printer maintenance and upgrades
Our goal is 
	1. [[Control]] the 3D Printers over web 
	2. [[Collect]] data from each print 
	3. [[Monitor]] 3D Printing process
	4. Develop a good [[data base]] for further developing [[machine learning models]] to [[detect failures]] in 3D Printing
